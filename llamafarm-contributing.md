Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
* **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the feature
* **Describe the current behavior** and explain what behavior you expected to see instead
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most LlamaFarm users

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/llamafarm/llamafarm-cli/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/llamafarm/llamafarm-cli/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## ðŸšœ Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llamafarm-cli.git
cd llamafarm-cli

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/llamafarm/llamafarm-cli.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Code Style

We use TypeScript and follow these conventions:

* 2 spaces for indentation
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Follow the existing code style
* Keep the farming theme alive! ðŸŒ¾

### Project Structure

```
llamafarm-cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands/      # CLI commands (plant, harvest, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/     # Code generation templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Utility functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cli.ts         # Main CLI entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test files
â””â”€â”€ docs/              # Documentation
```

### Adding a New Command

1. Create a new file in `src/commands/`
2. Export an async function that handles the command
3. Add the command to `src/cli.ts`
4. Add tests in `tests/`
5. Update the README.md

Example:
```typescript
// src/commands/mycommand.ts
import chalk from 'chalk';

export async function mycommandCommand(options: any) {
  console.log(chalk.green('ðŸŒ¾ My new command!'));
  // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits:

* `feat:` New feature
* `fix:` Bug fix
* `docs:` Documentation only changes
* `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
* `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `test:` Adding missing tests
* `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add support for Qdrant vector database
fix: correct port assignment in harvest command
docs: update README with new greenhouse options
```
