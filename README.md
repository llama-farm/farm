## 🚀 What is LLaMA Farm

Llama Farm packages your AI models, vector databases, and data pipelines into standalone binaries that run on any device - from Raspberry Pis to enterprise servers. **No Python. No CUDA hassles. No cloud bills.**

## Why LLaMA Farm?
The current cloud AI model makes us digital serfs, paying rent to use tools we don't own, feeding data to systems we don't control. The farm model makes us owners—of our models, our data, our future. But ownership requires responsibility. You must tend your farm.

When you own your model and your data, you own your future.  Let's make the AI revolution for EVERYONE. 

### The Old Way 😰
```bash
# Install Python, CUDA, dependencies...
# Debug version conflicts...
# Pay cloud bills...
# Wait for DevOps...
# 3 days later: "Why isn't it working?"
```

### The llamafarm Way 🌱
We are shipping in real time - join the revolution to help us go faster! 

```bash
llamafarm plant mixtral-8x7b --target raspberry-pi --agent chat123 --rag --database vector
🌱 Planting mixtral-8x7b...
🌱 Planting agent chat123
🌱 Planting vector database
🪴 Fertilizing database with RAG
✓ Dependencies bundled
✓ Baled and compiled to binary (2.3GB)
✓ Optimized for ARM64
